Steps:-

    Here are the steps on how to perform a GitHub Action CI/CD workflow:

- Create a new repository on GitHub.
- In the repository, create a new file called `.github/workflows/example.yml`.
- In the example.yml file, define the steps that need to be taken in the CI/CD workflow.
- Save the example.yml file.
- Push the example.yml file to the repository.
- Make a change to the code in the repository.
- Push the change to the repository.
- The CI/CD workflow will be triggered and the steps that you defined in the example.yml file will be executed.
   
You can customize the example.yml file to meet the specific needs of your project. For example, you can add additional steps to the workflow, such as building the application or deploying the application to a production environment.

By automating the process of building, testing, and deploying your application, you can ensure that your application is always in a working state. This can help to improve the reliability of your application and make it easier to maintain.
